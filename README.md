# Lab 2: JavaScript


### Exercise 1:

Create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The application should allow users to add tasks, mark them as completed,
and delete them.

Steps to follow:

1. Create HTML structure:
✓ Create an HTML file containing an empty <ul> list to display tasks.
✓ Add a form with a text field to enter new tasks and a
button to add them to the list.

2. Style with CSS:
✓ Use CSS to style the task list and form. You can add
borders, margins, fonts, etc. to improve your application's
appearance.

3. DOM manipulation with JavaScript:
✓ Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and make the application interactive.
✓ When the user submits the form, retrieve the text field value and
add it to the task list.

✓ Each task should have a button to mark it as completed and a button
to delete it from the list.

✓ When the user clicks the button to mark a task as completed,
add a CSS class to visually indicate the task is completed.

✓ When the user clicks the button to delete a task, remove it from the
list.

4. Handle user interactions:
✓ Use event handlers to detect clicks on add,
mark-as-completed and delete buttons.

✓ Make sure to update the DOM accordingly after each user
interaction.

5. Test and debug:
✓ Test your application by adding, marking as completed and deleting
tasks.

✓ Use your browser's developer tools to debug any
potential issues.

# Exercise 2:

Create a simple countdown timer that counts down from a given duration. The user should be able to set the timer duration, start, stop and reset the timer.

Steps to follow:

1. Create HTML structure:
✓ Create an HTML file containing elements to display the timer duration, buttons to start, stop and reset the timer, as well as an input field to allow the user to set the timer duration.

2. Style with CSS:
✓ Use CSS to style the application elements. You can add styles to make your timer's appearance attractive and user-friendly.

3. Time manipulation with JavaScript:
✓ Use JavaScript to handle the timer and user interactions.
✓ Retrieve the duration entered by the user using getElementById.
✓ Use setInterval to update the timer duration every second and display the remaining time in the user interface.
✓ Add event handlers to the start, stop and reset buttons.
✓ Make sure to update the user interface accordingly after each user interaction.

5. Test and debug:
✓ Test your application by starting, stopping and resetting the timer.
✓ Make sure the timer behaves as expected and user interactions work correctly.
✓ Use your browser's developer tools to debug any potential issues.
